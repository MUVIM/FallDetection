# **Multi Visual Modality Fall Detection Dataset (MUVIM)**

We introduce a novel multi-modality dataset (MUVIM) that contains four visual modalities: infra-red, depth, RGB and thermal cameras. These modalities offer benefits such as obfuscated facial features and improved performance in low-light conditions. Please read our pre-print here for more information: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12740)

For access to the dataset, email: bing.ye@utoronto.ca. Please set the subject line too "Fall detection data access request", and include your include title, email address, work address, and affiliation. In addition, a data privacy waiver will have to be completed.


In the file sample code, code is shared that can be referenced to help build a data pipeline and train a model. This code builds the work shared at: https://github.com/JJN123/Fall-Detection

Please use software such as 7-Zip to uncompress/unzip downloaded files. If data errors or loss persist, please try to redownload files. As mentioned in the dataset â€“ certain trials were lost due to data corruption during record. These files are largely removed from the dataset prior to be shared, however falls Fall49/, Fall143/, Fall159/ were included erroneously.
